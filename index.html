    title: Visualizing Toxicity in Twitter Conversations
    date: 2018-08-17 00:00:00 +0000
    host: medium.com/cortico
    banner: images/posts/twitter_reply_trees.jpg
    content: In late June, Deb Roy approached me to ask if I would be interested in doing some visualization work for a presentation he’d be giving at Twitter’s all-hands event with Bridgit Mendler. The talk was to be about toxicity in Twitter conversations, and would showcase the conversation analysis work being done in the lab, particularly around classifying replies as toxic or not.

    title: Visualizing the spread of true and false news on social media
    date: 2018-03-09 00:00:00 +0000
    host: sciencemag.org
    banner: images/posts/science_cover.jpg
    content: This cover depicts the breadth and depth of the spread of two different news stories through Twitter. The larger orange object (or cascade) represents a false news story, whereas the teal one represents a true news story. I aimed to illustrate the stark differences in how broadly and deeply false news spreads compared with true news, which are reflected in the relative size and complexity of the cascades.

    title: Smoothly animate thousands of points with HTML5 Canvas and D3
    date: 2017-03-16 00:00:00 +0000
    host: bocoup.com
    banner: images/posts/canvas1000_wide.jpg
    content: Sometimes in life, you’ve just gotta move thousands of points around on the screen. For hundreds of points, this can be accomplished with D3 through d3-transition on SVG nodes, but this typically becomes too slow when you need to animate more than a thousand points. So how do you do it?

    title:  Showing Missing Data in Line Charts
    date: 2016-09-20 00:00:00 +0000
    host: bocoup.com
    banner: images/posts/missing_data_line.png
    content: While working on visualizing the results of internet speed test data for Measurement Lab, it became clear that there wouldn’t always be data for every geographic location on every single day. We might go several days without meeting a minimum threshold of tests, meaning there would be gaps in our data.

    title:  Improving D3 Path Animation
    date: 2016-09-14 00:00:00 +0000
    host: bocoup.com
    banner: images/posts/path_animation.png
    content: D3 provides us with many of the basic building blocks needed to make charts in browsers while also making it extremely easy to animate them. One of the most common charts created with D3 is a line chart, often consisting of a series of SVG <path> elements to visualize the data.

    title:  "React and Vega: An Alternative Visualization Example"
    date: 2016-03-01 00:00:00 +0000
    host: medium.com
    banner: images/posts/react_vega.png
    content: In this post, I’ll go over an example of how to render a couple of charts by creating React components that encapsulate Vega visualizations. The final code has a line chart and a radial heatmap that are synchronized so that when you hover over one, the same item in each of the charts is highlighted.

    title:  Linked Highlighting with React, D3.js and Reflux
    date: 2015-05-04 00:00:00 +0000
    host: medium.com
    banner: images/posts/react_d3.png
    content: One of the best interaction techniques for data vis is to have linked highlighting between related visualizations. In this post, I share a method for implementing linked highlighting using React, D3.js and Reflux.
